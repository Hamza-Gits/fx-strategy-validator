# GBPUSD London Breakout — Master Context File
**Last updated:** 2026-04-29
**Status:** EA v5 — entry-mechanism fixed (pending stop orders), Iter 10 default

## v5 Critical Update (2026-04-29)
**MT5 Report 17 (v4) was a disaster:** PF 0.91, 343 trades (vs Python 667), -$2,251 loss. Root cause: TWO entry-mechanism bugs.

**Bug 1: Entry slippage.** v4 used market orders that filled 20-50 pips beyond the range boundary. Python assumes fills AT the boundary (stop order behaviour). R:R collapsed from 1:1.5 to 1:0.25 in many trades.

**Bug 2: Missing entry bar.** v4's `hour < InpLondonEndHour=10` only checked 2 of the 3 London bars Python checks (missed the 09:00-10:00 bar's close). That's 33% of breakouts gone, explaining 343 vs 667 trades.

**v5 fix:** Pending **BuyStop @ asian_high** + **SellStop @ asian_low** placed at 07:00 GMT, expiring 10:00 GMT. OCO logic cancels the unfilled side when one fills. Matches Python's fill model exactly.

## What This Project Is
A fully validated algorithmic trading strategy for GBPUSD, targeting deployment on The5ers prop firm (MT5). The strategy captures London session open range breakouts using Asian session price range as reference.

## ⚠️ HARD CONSTRAINT: 10% MAX DRAWDOWN

User has set an absolute max drawdown limit of **10%** for the personal account.

This rules out almost all of the council's iterations (Iter 1 has DD 19.1% — violates). The only iteration that fits:
- **Iter 9: Flat 0.5%** — Max DD 6.66%, but CAGR only 7.4% (never hits 3x in 10y)

For 2-3x in <3y AND <10% DD, we need a hybrid:
- **Capped progressive risk** with `InpTrailingDDPct = 10.0` and soft recovery firing well before that cap
- Trade smaller (0.5%–0.75%) — accept slower growth in exchange for hard DD safety

The v4 EA's `InpTrailingDDPct` default has been raised to 25 historically, but per this constraint the effective deployment value is **10**, with soft recovery triggering at 7-8%.

## Position Sizing — All 13 iterations vs 10% DD / <5y constraint
| Iter | Rule | DD | 2x time | 3x time | <10% DD? | <5y to 2x? |
|------|------|----|---------|---------|----------|------------|
| 1 | 0.5→1→1.5% prog | 19.1% | 2.67y | 4.85y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 2 | 1% base, 2% on 6-win | 13.0% | 4.67y | 8.36y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 3 | Flat 2% | 24.9% | 2.00y | 3.83y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 4 | Kelly 1.5% base | 20.2% | 2.67y | 6.00y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 5 | 1→1.5→2% | 23.2% | 2.17y | 4.60y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 6 | Flat 3% | 35.5% | 1.70y | 2.08y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 7 | 2→2.5→3% prog | 35.5% | 1.71y | 2.08y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 8 | 1.5→2→2.5% scaling | 31.9% | 2.00y | 3.80y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 9 | Flat 0.5% | 6.66% | 9.80y | N/A | ✅ | ❌ |
| **10** | **Flat 0.75%** | **9.88%** | **7.49y** | **N/A** | **✅** | ❌ |
| 11 | Flat 1.0% | 13.0% | 4.70y | 8.40y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 12 | Slow prog 0.5→0.75→1.0% | 13.0% | 4.70y | 8.42y | ❌ | ✅ |
| 13 | Flat 1.0% with loss-cut | 14.5% | 4.90y | 8.59y | ❌ | ✅ |

**Honest truth:** No single-pair sizing rule satisfies BOTH "<10% DD" AND "2x in <5y" simultaneously.

- **Iter 10 (flat 0.75%)** is the only iteration under 10% DD — but takes 7.5y to 2x
- **Iter 11 (flat 1.0%)** hits 2x in 4.7y — but DD is 13%
- For 2x in <5y with <10% DD on a single pair, the edge isn't strong enough

**Path forward:** multi-pair diversification (run Iter 9/10 sizing on 3+ uncorrelated pairs). Aggregate return scales linearly; aggregate DD stays bounded due to uncorrelated drawdowns. Currently only GBPUSD has the validated edge — next research step is validating EURUSD/USDJPY breakouts.

---

## Council Verdict (revised for 10% DD constraint)

**Recommendation: Iter 9 (flat 0.5%)** as the personal-account default.
- Compliant with 10% DD constraint
- Same settings work for The5ers $10k evaluation (their max DD is 4%, this stays well within)
- Slow but survivable

**For 2-3x in <3y goal:** consider running Iter 9 across **3 uncorrelated pairs** (GBPUSD, USDJPY, EURUSD if they pass validation) — total return scales roughly 3× while DD remains ~10% (uncorrelated drawdowns).

## MT5 EA File
`mql5_ea/LondonBreakout_v5.mq5` — current version: **v5.0**

### Version History
| Version | Change |
|---------|--------|
| v1 | Initial build |
| v2 | CSV trade logger |
| v3 | Progressive risk sizing |
| v3.1 | Fix CopyRates; cache Asian range; bar-based check |
| v3.2 | Daily DD now resets each day; trailing DD 8%→15% |
| v4 | Soft recovery halt; InpHardHalt toggle for prop firm; 21-column CSV |
| **v5** | **Pending stop orders** at range boundaries (matches Python fill model); **OCO logic** cancels unfilled side; **entry-window fix** captures all 3 London bars; default risk = Iter 10 (flat 0.75%) |

### Why v4 Was Built
v3.2's trailing DD halt was still permanent. Phase 3 risk × loss streak triggered it → flatline 2018-onward. v4 replaces with soft recovery: pause 30 days at 0.5%, reset peak watermark, resume.

### Recommended v5 Settings (Iter 10 — best fit under 10% DD)
```
InpUseProgressiveRisk = false      ← flat risk (Iter 10)
InpRiskPercent        = 0.75       ← Iter 10 flat 0.75% (Python DD 9.88%)
InpHardHalt           = false      ← soft recovery
InpTrailingDDPct      = 8.0        ← soft recovery fires under 10% cap
InpRecoveryDays       = 30
InpRecoveryRiskPct    = 0.25       ← halved during recovery
```

---

## Broker: The5ers
- All-in cost: 0.9–1.3 pips
- Evaluation target: +8% on $10k, max DD 4%, no time limit

**The5ers $10k evaluation settings:**
```
InpHardHalt           = true
InpTrailingDDPct      = 4.0
InpDailyLossLimitPct  = 3.0
InpUseProgressiveRisk = false
InpRiskPercent        = 0.5
```

**Compliance:** All 13 prohibited practices verified — see `docs/the5ers_compliance.md`.

---

## Next Steps
1. **Rerun MT5 backtest** with v4 + Iter 9 settings + InpTrailingDDPct=10 (2014.11–2024.12)
2. **Verify DD stays under 10%** — if it doesn't, drop to 0.25% risk
3. **Validate 2025 forward test** (Python)
4. **Multi-pair diversification research** — only path to 2-3x in <3y with 10% DD cap
5. **Demo trade** before The5ers challenge

## How to Resume in a New Chat
1. Read this file first (`CONTEXT.md`)
2. Read `STRATEGY_REPORT.md` for full research background
3. Read `ITERATION_REPORT.md` for sizing decisions + council verdict
4. Check latest git log: `git log --oneline -10`
5. **Note user's 10% DD hard cap** — this rules out all but Iter 9
6. Current task: rerun MT5 backtest with v4 + 10% DD config
